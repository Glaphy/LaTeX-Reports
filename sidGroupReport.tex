\section{Introduction to the Direct Method}
The direct method is possibly the most logically straightforward way to solve
for the values of the mesh points. It involves expressing the relationships of
the various grid points with each other through a system of simultaneous
equations, and then solving this system to obtain a vector containing the
solutions to the mesh points.
